# The Creator of Man

<strong>The Beginning Created</strong><br/>
<i>Gen1:1</i><br/><br/>

Before time there was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <br/>
*Kudala kongakabikhona ngisho isikhathi; kwakukhona uLizwi, uLizwi wayekuNkulunkulu, uLizwi wayenguNkulunkulu* <br/><br/>

In the beginning (time), God created the heavens (space) and the earth (matter). <br/>
God put everything in order so that it might become His dwelling place,<br/>
the place of His presence, displaying His glory.<br/>
*Ekuqaleni (kwesikhathi), uNkulunkulu wadala izulu (ukhathi) nomhlaba (ukuthintekayo).*<br/>
*uNkulunkulu wase enza ukuhleleka kukho konke akudalile, ukuze kube indawo yakhe yokuhlala,*<br/>
*kube indawo lapho engatholakala khona, ekhombisa inkazimulo yakhe.*<br/><br/>

Thus, “in the beginning” refers to the beginning of everything.<br/> 
God created everything in the universe,<br/> 
which means that He created it out of nothing.<br/><br/>

Everything that was created was created by the Word of God.<br/>
God’s absolute power is seen in that He merely speaks,<br/>
and things are created.<br/><br/>
*Konke ukubonakalayo nokungabonakali kwavela ngoLizwi ekuNkulunkulu.*<br/>
*Amandla kaNkulunkulu abonakala ngokuthi umane akhulume,*<br/>
*bese kudaleka loko akufunayo (kuvele kudaleke emoyeni)*<br/><br/>

By the power of the Word of God, all of space, all of time,<br/>
all of matter in the universe were created.<br/>
*Ngamandla kaLizwi ekuNkulunkulu, wonk'ukhathi, sonke is'khathi,*<br/>
*konke*<br/>

(1) summary: *"Konke isikwaziyo, okubonakalayo nokungabonakali, okusemhlabeni*<br/>
*nokusezulwini; kwadalwa uNkulunkulu.*<br/>
*Konke kwadalwa uLizwi ekuNkulunkulu".*

<b>The Man Created</b><br/>
<i>Gen1:26-27</i><br/><br/>

Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”.<br/>
Many Christians believe that “let us” means God speaking to Himself.<br/>
If so, this would be the first biblical reference to the “Trinity”.<br/><br/>

Human beings are not made in the image of angels (sons of God),<br/>
and there is no mention of angels participating in the creation of man.<br/><br/>

The Hebrew word for man (‘adam), is a generic term for both male and female.<br/><br/>

So God created man in His own image, in the image of God he created him;<br/>
male and female he created them. Adam, whose name means "man", was the <br/>
first human being. Adam was created out of dust and the breath of God, <br/>
so became a living soul made in the image of God.<br/><brl/>
The term "Image of God" refers to the nature that God intended humans to have.<br/>
God created Adam with only the ability to manifests His character in who he was and<br/>
in everything he did. So for a while Adam was immortal, and walked with God, everything<br/>
he did was good and perfect.<br/><br/>
Now Adam was the only one of his kind, he didn't have anyone else to help him.<br/>
God created Eve as a helper for Adam, and together they enjoyed perfect<br/>
fellowship with their Creator.<br/><br/>

(2) summary: *"Isidalwa esingumuntu sadalwa uNkulunkulu ngomfanekiso wakhe,*<br/>
*esidalela ukuthi sibenenjabulo, sembathe inkazimulo bese sibe nokuphila okuphakade."*

<b>The Fall of Man</b><br/>
<i>Gen3:1</i><br/><br/>

But Adam and Eve chose to disobey God,<br/>
which brought sin and death into the world. Adam and Eve had children<br/>
after their fallen likeness. Because of their sin, all humans are now<br/>
born sinners and will someday die.<br/><br/>

(3) summary: *"Isidalwa esinguAdam sathi sesinosizi waso*<br/>
*engowesifazane; behamba ze bobabili kodwa bengenamahloni bengesabi, (ngoba bembathe inkazimulo)*<br/>
*base bona ngokwenza okuphikisana nom'yalelo kaNkulunkulu."*

<b>The Problem</b></br>
<i>Joh3:16, 1Cor15:22</i><br/><br/>

For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.<br/>
Now for every sin committed there must be a payment of death.<br/>
Not just the death of flesh, but the death of a soul that lived<br/>
in the flesh. As in Adam all man have sinned, then all man must<br/>
have eternal death as a punishment for sin. No man born of Adam<br/>
can die for sins of other that they may have eternal life.<br/>
Only a son of man born of God has the power to die for all those<br/>
who have sinned that they may have eternal life.<br/><br/>

(4) summary: *"Uvuzo wokona kwabo kwaba kukhulahlekelwa; injabulo,*<br/>
*inkazimulo nokuphila okuphakade. Mabebona ukuthi bahamba ze,*<br/>
*base beba namahloni nokwesaba. Emvakwalokho uAdam nomkakhe basebeba"*<br/>
*nabantwana ngomfanekiso wabo, ongenayo injabulo, ongenayo inkazimulo,*<br/>
*ongenako ukuphila ukuphade"*

<b>The Word Became Flesh</b></br>
<i>Joh3:16, Joh1:9-14</i><br/><br/>

For God so loved the man and his children, whom He created,<br/>
that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should<br/>
not perish but have eternal life.<br/><br/>

The Word which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.<br/>
His was in the world that was made through Him, yet the world<br/>
did not recognise Him and His own people did not receive Him.<br/>
But to all who receive Him, who believe in His name, He gave the<br/>
right to become children of God, who are born, not of blood nor<br/>
of the will of flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. And the<br/>
Word became flesh and dwelt amoung us.
